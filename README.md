# AI-ML Playbook

A practical playbook of **AI and Machine Learning concepts, code examples, and real-world patterns**—covering modern ML, generative AI, agentic workflows, and scalable deployments.

This repository accompanies my AI/ML blogs and articles. Each folder maps to a specific concept or post and contains **runnable code, experiments, and reference implementations** designed to be easy to follow and extend.

## What You’ll Find Here

This playbook focuses on *how things work in practice*, not just theory.

Topics include:
- Classical and modern Machine Learning
- Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agentic and multi-agent systems
- Self-refinement, critique, and evaluation loops
- Explainability and reliability patterns
- Scalable deployment examples (Docker, cloud, inference)

## Repository Structure

```text
ai-ml-playbook/
├── blogs/          # Code mapped directly to blog posts
```

## How to Use This Playbook

- Read a blog post or article
- Navigate to the corresponding folder under blogs/
- Follow the local README or script to run the example
- Modify and extend the code for your own use cases

The code is intentionally modular and lightweight, making it easy to adapt to different projects.

## Intended Audience

This repository is for:

- Engineers and developers learning modern AI/ML
- Practitioners building production-oriented ML systems
- Researchers prototyping ideas and evaluations
- Students looking for practical, runnable examples

If you prefer learning through code, experiments, and concrete patterns, this playbook is for you.
